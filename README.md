# Self-Correction Language Model Training

This project is a Pytorch and Transformers implementation of the SCoRe (Self-Correction via Reinforcement Learning) method for training language models to improve their self-correction abilities over multiple attempts. The training regime is based on the paper **["Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12917)**.

## Overview

The script trains a language model to improve its responses over multiple turns by self-correcting based on its own generated outputs. It follows a two-stage reinforcement learning process:

1. **Stage I**: Fine-tunes the model to improve the second attempt while keeping the first attempt close to the base model's outputs.
2. **Stage II**: Trains the model using multi-turn RL to optimize both attempts, with a reward bonus to promote effective self-correction.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate tqdm
```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python main.py [--arguments]
```

## Arguments

- `--model_name`: Name of the model to train (default: `'unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct'`).
- `--dataset_name`: Name of the dataset to use (default: `'lighteval/MATH'`).
- `--question_column`: Column name for the questions in the dataset (default: `'problem'`).
- `--answer_column`: Column name for the gold standard answers in the dataset (default: `'solution'`).

Example:

```bash
python main.py --model_name 'unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct' --dataset_name 'lighteval/MATH' --question_column 'problem' --answer_column 'solution'
```

## Output Files

- `accuracies.txt`: Contains the accuracies of the first and second attempts during training and evaluation.
- `generations.txt`: Contains the prompts and generations (first and second attempts) during training and evaluation.
